Users who have run into roadblocks like authentication or found our APIs confusing/challenging, are welcome to come and make these non-issues moving forward. The first half of the talk covers the Google APIs Client Library, specifically with Python, although you could use any of the other languages supported. We'll then describe the steps necessary to create projects & enable Google APIs from the Google Developers Console. Then we discuss how to create & access the needed credentials. Code demos will show you how to use this code to talk to a variety of Google APIs. While you do the same thing using JavaScript, there is another developer tool that gives you access to Google APIs but in a slightly different way. The second half of the talk covers Google Apps Script, a self-contained JavaScript environment in the Google cloud. You'll learn what Apps Script is and how it's more like using \"services\" than traditional APIs. We'll show you how to use its development environment and create a Google Sheets spreadsheet that talks to several Google APIs. The applications you build, whether they use the Client Library or Apps Script are reachable by any client, browser, desktop/laptop or mobile. Come join us and learn how to leverage the power of Google technologies in the next apps you build!",

Over the years my group has been perfecting how to build world-class Android Apps at the speed of thought first for hackathons, then products and now for design sprints. In this session, we will detail the “Speed of Thought” methodology, steps, tools and components involved. We start by utilizing a design sprint to explore the power of mobile and how it fits into the market/problem we are trying to solve.  Then focusing on the crucial step in a design sprint we build high fidelity prototypes in rapid succession utilizing the JetPack Android software components (UI, Behavior, Foundation, Architecture) to take full advantage of the Android platform.  We do this by leveraging the design features of Android Studio (material components / theme editor, constraint library, motion editor) along with open source/industry resources to build an intuitive and beautiful UI.  Once the UI framework is done we write the Kotlin application logic utilizing the Android Architecture Components with data binding connected to Firebase for the synchronized backend.  With our application finished we execute our strategy for marketing, distribution, and monetization guided by Data-Driven Ethnography (DDE).  At the end of the session, the audience will have a good idea of how in rapid secession all these tools and components come together to produce magic.",
